# 👨‍💻 Personal Development Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website built using Next.js. The website serves as a dynamic and interactive online resume, offering a traditional resume format at the top of the main page while providing additional sections for more detailed information about me and my various projects.

**Note**: This website is currently under development, and the live link will be provided once it's hosted.

## 🚀 Features

- **Main Page Resume**: The top section of the main page resembles a traditional resume with key details about my education, work experience, skills, and contact information. This section provides a quick overview for potential employers.

- **Detailed About Me**: Scroll down the main page to learn more about me, my interests, hobbies, and anything else I'd like to share.

- **Projects Showcase**: The 'Projects' page showcases a variety of projects I've worked on, including programming projects, hardware-related projects, content creation, and more. At least, that's the intention.
